Won't it be fun to drive a rc car using your hand gesture? We tried to achive the same by using MPU6050 IMU connected to Arduino nano send conmands to Arduino nano 
on the bot, which is controlling the bot, via wifi module. Everthing is powered via rechargable Li-Ion batteries.

## Components:

- Bot: The rc car with all the control systems

- Gesture recognising module: held in hand, or worn on hand which controls the bot.
